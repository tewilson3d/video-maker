  "storyPrompt": "A near-future battlefield during an ongoing interstellar war. The environment is ruined and industrial, reduced to debris, smoke, and broken terrain. Visibility is low, the color palette muted and cold. \n\nThe story follows a single human infantry soldier wearing a living biomechanical combat suit. The suit is not armor in the traditional sense — it is a biological system fused to the body, quietly monitoring, regulating, and optimizing the wearer. The soldier believes the suit is protecting him.\n\nCombat unfolds with sudden efficiency. Enemy contact is abrupt and unspectacular. The soldier moves with unnatural precision, reacting faster than conscious thought. Weapons fire, reloads, and evasive maneuvers occur automatically, guided by the suit. There is no heroism, no panic — only controlled execution.\n\nDuring the fight, the soldier is injured. The wound is sealed instantly by the suit’s organic fibers. Pain is muted, treated as information rather than sensation. The soldier does not slow down. The battle continues uninterrupted.\n\nAt key moments, the suit overrides the soldier’s intent — redirecting movement, prioritizing targets, choosing survival paths. The soldier briefly registers this loss of control but accepts it without resistance. The suit knows better.\n\nNearby, another soldier is killed. The death happens quickly and without emphasis, absorbed into the background of combat. The protagonist does not stop or react. Mission continuity outweighs human loss.\n\nAs the fighting subsides, the battlefield noise fades. The suit remains active, calm, and dominant. Internal systems confirm optimal efficiency and regulated stress. The human presence is quieter now — reduced to breath and compliance.\n\nThe tone is restrained, clinical, and unsettling. The horror is not violence, but the quiet realization that the suit is becoming the primary actor, and the human is becoming incidental. The scene ends in calm, not chaos — with the sense that the system will endure, regardless of the individual inside it."
